    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <section id="intro">
        Driven by a passion for continuous growth, I have successfully completed projects utilizing frameworks 
        such as Spring Boot, React, Vue and Django. These projects have provided me with hands-on experience in software engineering, 
        where I have developed robust applications that leverage the power of modern technologies.
